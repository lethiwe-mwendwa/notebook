✅ Why This is a Good Plan
🧪 1. Foundational Mathematics
Multivariable Calculus & Linear Algebra are non-negotiable. They're the backbone of almost every field in applied math, mechanics, and simulations (e.g. deformation gradients, tensors, finite element methods).

Applied Linear Algebra gets you comfortable with matrix factorizations, eigenvalue problems, and numerical stability — essential for real-world computation and mechanics.

📀 2. Analysis and Functional Analysis
Real Analysis sharpens your mathematical maturity and helps with understanding convergence, continuity, and rigor — useful in numerical analysis and PDE theory.

Fourier & Functional Analysis are foundational to solving PDEs, especially in heat, wave, and quantum systems. Also useful for signal processing in physics/engineering.

🔁 3. Differential Equations
ODEs show up in particle mechanics, control systems, circuits.

PDEs are the heart of continuum mechanics (e.g. Navier–Stokes, elasticity, diffusion). You can’t do computational mechanics without understanding these deeply.

🌲 4. Probability & Stochastic Processes
While less central than analysis/differential equations for deterministic mechanics, these become vital in:

Uncertainty quantification

Monte Carlo simulations

Stochastic modeling of physical systems (e.g. Brownian motion, turbulence)

And essential if you branch into computational physics or machine learning.

🖥️ 5. Numerical and Scientific Computing
Absolutely essential. You need these to implement everything else on a computer.

Covers solving ODEs/PDEs, discretization, numerical linear algebra, and stability — which is the heart of computational mechanics.

📊 6. Optimization & Modeling
Optimization appears in:

Mechanics (e.g. energy minimization, inverse problems)

Engineering design

Control theory

Mathematical Modeling is how theory connects to reality. It trains you to take a physical situation, abstract it, and simulate it.

🧠 7. Advanced Electives
Pick based on your eventual specialization:

Dynamical systems & chaos theory → important in nonlinear mechanics and real-world behavior.

Signal processing & inverse problems → useful in imaging, materials testing, and anything where you reconstruct or interpret physical data.

Complex Analysis → nice-to-have if doing any analytical methods or physics.

🌍 8. Interdisciplinary Applications
These show you how to apply your knowledge:

Physics (especially mechanics) → aligns perfectly with your interests.

Engineering applications (e.g. FEM, control) are exactly where computational mechanics lives.

Computer science (algorithms, ML) helps with scalable simulations, solvers, and optimization.

🔧 How to Tackle This
You don’t need to do all of it at once. Here’s a reasonable order:

Start with:

Multivariable calculus

Linear algebra

ODEs

Then:

PDEs

Numerical methods

Real analysis (at least intuitive)

As you get comfortable:

Fourier/Functional analysis

Scientific computing tools (e.g. NumPy/SciPy, C++, Julia)

Mathematical modeling

Specialize later with electives based on what excites you or what your simulation projects need.

✅ Verdict: Yes — pursue this
This is a rigorous, powerful roadmap. It’s not light, but it’s directly relevant to:

Building simulations

Understanding the math behind mechanics

Gaining the depth needed for a master's or research in computational mechanics

You can absolutely treat this as a self-study degree in applied mathematics for simulation and mechanics.

Let me know if you want help breaking this into a weekly/monthly study plan, or picking textbooks for each section.


✅ Your Given Order (With Commentary)
1. 🧪 Foundational Mathematics
Multivariable Calculus & Linear Algebra → Applied Linear Algebra
✅ Perfect starting point.

These are the raw tools used everywhere else.

Applied Linear Algebra builds directly on the fundamentals.

2. 📀 Analysis and Functional Analysis
Real Analysis → Fourier & Functional Analysis
✅ Good progression.

Real Analysis builds rigor and prepares you for understanding infinite-dimensional spaces.

Fourier & Functional Analysis are naturally more advanced and build off this.

Optional tweak:
You could interleave some Fourier analysis before full real analysis if you're aiming for practical PDE solutions early — many courses do this.

3. 🔁 Differential Equations
ODEs → PDEs
✅ Excellent flow.

ODEs are simpler and appear in almost all physical systems.

PDEs are more complex and naturally follow from ODEs.

4. 🌲 Probability & Stochastic Processes
Core Probability → Stochastic Processes
✅ Clear progression.

You need foundational probability before you can make sense of stochastic systems.

These are helpful once you’ve got deterministic systems down.

5. 🖥️ Numerical and Scientific Computing
Numerical Methods → Scientific Computing Tools
✅ Spot-on ordering.

First understand the algorithms, then the tools (like C++, Python, MATLAB) to implement them.

Don’t skip numerical linear algebra!

Note: You could also introduce some computing tools early to help with learning earlier topics, e.g., visualizing multivariable functions or solving ODEs.

6. 📊 Optimization & Modeling
Optimization → Mathematical Modeling
✅ Strong choice.

Optimization techniques underpin many modeling strategies and numerical methods.

Modeling is where everything comes together and is best learned after you’ve built some technical maturity.

7. 🧠 Advanced Electives
Pick 3–4 as specialization
✅ Right place for these.

Once you've built core skills, you can explore advanced topics depending on your interests (e.g., dynamical systems, inverse problems).

8. 🌍 Interdisciplinary Applications
Physics, Engineering, CS
✅ Beautifully placed as a capstone.

These serve as both motivation and application.

They can be explored alongside or after the core curriculum — this is where you “build stuff.”

🔁 Summary
Your order is excellent. It's:

Pedagogically sound (from fundamentals → theory → numerics → application)

Aligned with your interests in computational mechanics

Modular, meaning you can move pieces around depending on what you want to build or understand next
